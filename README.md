# Free, easy-to-setup and fully customisable Minecraft server running on Raspberry Pi 4 (Ubuntu)
This small project was born from a desire to learn linux and a love for Minecraft. There is some good documentation about setting up minecraft server on linux but none is as simple as this one. I will go through every step from flashing Ubuntu on your SD card to settting up automatic backups for you server.

# Requirements
- Raspberry Pi 4 (any model) or any other ubuntu pc that can work 24/7
- Raspberry Pi cooling sytem if you wish to overclock the Pi
- another pc to remotely setup and administrate the server
- Ethernet cable
- Micro SD card (32gb or more recommended)

# Step 1 : Prep
Before flashing Ubuntu on your SD card, make sure you format it. Flash Ubuntu Server (LTS) for Raspberry Pi (link below) on your SD card. You have to plug the Raspberry Pi next to your router because you will have to plug it in using an Ethernet cable. Once the Pi is started, we will access the command line through Putty (link below). To do so, you will need to know the local IP adress of the Pi which you can
